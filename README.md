What this project got so far:
 - The process is documented on the code comments, did the best i could to try and explain it.
 - Tile analysis and rule generation, considering y axis rotation
 - Generator using  rules for seamless connections (still some problems but almost ok).

Future prospects:
 - Using the algorithm to generate seamless closed paths for a race track generator.
